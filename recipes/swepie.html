<h2><ins>Description</ins></h2>
<p>Some dishes sweep in and become a natural part of the tradition in only a few short years. That’s the case with Västerbottensostpaj, a pie made with Västerbotten cheese. According to food historian Rickard Tellström,
the pie is the Swedish version of the French Quiche Lorraine, which became a big hit in the 80s.
<br>
The Västerbotten cheese pie is easy to make and to prepare in advance. You can guess how it sneaked into the hearts of the Swedes, right? <br>
Yes, it was through smörgåsbord. Today, you can expect to find this golden pie at buffet tables at parties and celebrations such as Midsummer. It is pretty much mandatory for a Swedish crayfish party.</p>
