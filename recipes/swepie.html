<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Some dishes sweep in and become a natural part of the tradition in only a few short years. That’s the case with Västerbottensostpaj, a pie made with Västerbotten cheese. According to food historian Rickard Tellström,
the pie is the Swedish version of the French Quiche Lorraine, which became a big hit in the 80s.

The Västerbotten cheese pie is easy to make and to prepare in advance. You can guess how it sneaked into the hearts of the Swedes, right? <br>
Yes, it was through smörgåsbord. Today, you can expect to find this golden pie at buffet tables at parties and celebrations such as Midsummer. It is pretty much mandatory for a Swedish crayfish party.</p>
