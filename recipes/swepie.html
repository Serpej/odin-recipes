<h2><ins>Description</ins></h2>
<p>Some dishes sweep in and become a natural part of the tradition in only a few short years. That’s the case with Västerbottensostpaj, a pie made with Västerbotten cheese. According to food historian Rickard Tellström,
the pie is the Swedish version of the French Quiche Lorraine, which became a big hit in the 80s.
<br>
The Västerbotten cheese pie is easy to make and to prepare in advance. You can guess how it sneaked into the hearts of the Swedes, right? <br>
Yes, it was through smörgåsbord. Today, you can expect to find this golden pie at buffet tables at parties and celebrations such as Midsummer. It is pretty much mandatory for a Swedish crayfish party.</p>

<h3><ins>Ingredients</ins></h3>
<ul>
<strong><ins>For the pie crust</ins></strong>
    <li>3 dl (1 1/3 cup) flour</li>
    <li>125 g (1/2 cup) cold butter</li>
    <li>1-2 tbsp cold water</li>
    <br>
<strong><ins>For the filling</ins></strong>
    <li>3 eggs</li>
    <li>1 dl (2/5 cup) milk</li>
    <li>1 dl (2/5 cup) cream</li>
    <li>200 g (7 oz) Västerbotten cheese (or another flavorful cheese such as Cheddar)</li>
    <li>1/2 tsp salt</li>
    <li>1 pinch white pepper</li>
<br>
<strong><ins>Fish roe sauce (optional)</ins></strong>
    <li>2 dl (4/5 cup) crème fraîche</li>
    <li>3 tbsp fish roe</li>
    <li>2 tbsp finely chopped dill</li>
    <li>2 tbsp finely chopped dill</li>
    <li>salt, pepper, and lemon juice to taste</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h3><ins>Instructions</ins></h3>
<ol>
    <li>Prepare the pie crust by mixing together the flour, butter, and one tablespoon of water in a large bowl until it comes together into a dough. <br>
        I do this with my hands. If necessary, add another tablespoon of water, making it two in total. Wrap the dough in cling film and place it in the fridge for 20-60 minutes.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Set the oven to 200°C (390°F).</li>
    <br>
    <li>Make the filling by whisking together the eggs, milk, and cream together. Add the grated cheese. Season with salt and white pepper and stir until it is all well combined.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Take out the dough and press it out into a pie pan. Pick it with a fork and pre-bake the crust in the oven for 10 minutes.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Add the filling to the pre-baked pie crust. Bake in the oven for 20-25 minutes, until the filling has set and become a bit golden. <br>
        Be careful so it doesn’t burn — add a bit of aluminum foil on top and bake the pie a bit longer if the surface is ready but the filling still loose when you move the pie. However, the pie will set a bit more after cooling. The pie is best served lukewarm.</li>
    <br>
    <li>If you want to make a simple cold fish roe sauce, take a small bowl and stir together crème fraîche with fish roe, chopped dill, and chopped onion. Season with salt, pepper, and a squirt of lemon juice according to your own taste.</li>
